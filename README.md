## Storage
Data is stored within browser cache memory. Therefore make sure to backup your data anytime you wish to clean your browser cache memory.

Don't use Task Planner to store sensible data. If the browser gets compromised your data might not be safe. Also bugs within the application itself might lead to permanent data loss.
